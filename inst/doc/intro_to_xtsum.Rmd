# Introduction
```xtsum``` is an R wrapper based on ```STATA``` ```xtsum``` command, it used to provide summary statistics for a panel data set. It decomposes the variable $x_{it}$ into a between $(\bar{x_i})$ and within $(x_{it} − \bar{x_i} + \bar{\bar{x}})$, the global mean x being added back in make results comparable, see [@stata]. 


# Installation
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("xtsum")

# For dev version
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("macosso/xtsum")
```

# Getting Started

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the librarry
library(xtsum)
```

## xtsum 
This function computes summary statistics for panel data, including overall statistics, between-group statistics, and within-group statistics.

**Usage**
```
xtsum(
  data,
  variables = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  t = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  return.data.frame = TRUE,
  dec = 3
)
```

**Arguments**

* ```data``` A data.frame or pdata.frame object representing panel data.

* ``` variables```	(Optional) Vector of variable names for which to calculate statistics. If not provided, all numeric variables in the data will be used.

* ```id``` (Optional) Name of the individual identifier variable.

* ```t```	(Optional) Name of the time identifier variable.

* ```na.rm```	Logical indicating whether to remove NAs when calculating statistics.

* ```return.data.frame``` If the return object should be a dataframe

* ```dec``` Number of significant digits to report

### Example

#### Genral example
Based on National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, 14-24 years old in 1968

```{r}
data("nlswork", package = "sampleSelection")
xtsum(nlswork, "hours", id = "idcode", t = "year", na.rm = T, dec = 6)
```

The table above can be interpreted as below paraphrased from [@stata].

The overall and within are calculated over ```N = 28,467``` person-years of data. The between is calculated over ```n = 4,710``` persons, and the average number of years a person was observed in the hours data is```T = 6```.

```xtsum``` also reports standard deviation(```SD```), minimums(```Min```), and maximums(```Max```).

Hours worked varied between ```Overal Min = 1``` and ```Overall Max = 168```. Average hours worked for each woman varied between ```between Min = 1``` and ```between Max = 83.5```. 
“Hours worked within” varied between ```within Min = −2.15``` and ```within Max = 130.1```, which is not to say that any woman actually worked negative hours. The within number refers to the deviation from each individual’s average, and naturally, some of those deviations must be negative. Then the negative value is not disturbing but the positive value is. Did some woman really deviate from her average by +130.1 hours? No. In our definition of within, we add back in the global average of 36.6 hours. Some woman did deviate
from her average by 130.1 − 36.6 = 93.5 hours, which is still large.

The reported standard deviations tell us that the variation in hours worked last week across women is nearly equal to that observed within a woman over time. That is, if you were to draw two women randomly from our data, the difference in hours worked is expected to be nearly equal to the difference for the same woman in two randomly selected years.

More detailed interpretation can be found in handout[@stephenporter]


#### Using pdata.frame object
```{r, fig.show='hold'}
data("Gasoline", package = "plm")
Gas <- pdata.frame(Gasoline, index = c("country", "year"), drop.index = TRUE)
xtsum(Gas)
```
#### Using regular data.frame with id and t specified
```{r}
data("Crime", package = "plm")
xtsum(Crime, variables = c("polpc", "avgsen", "crmrte"), id = "county", t = "year")
```

#### Specifying variables to include in the summary
```{r}
xtsum(Gas, variables = c("lincomep", "lgaspcar"))
```

#### Returning a data.frame object
Returning a data.frame might be useful if one wishes to perform additional manipulation with the data or if you intend to use other rporting packages such as stargazer [@hlavac_2018_stargazer] or kabel[@zhu_2021_create].
```{r, fig.show='hold'}
xtsum(Gas, variables = c("lincomep", "lgaspcar"), return.data.frame = TRUE)
```
